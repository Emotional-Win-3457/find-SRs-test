# find-SRs
This program detects evidence for support & resistance (sr) zones in historical [forex] data. It's a project of the reddit r/algotrading community. It's intended purpose is to facilitate backtesting of strategies: either to exploit S&R zones, or to avoid trading near them.

My first publicly released Python code and my first Github submission. I am obviously not a Python coder. Please be gentle.

The program is written to use the Dukascopy download CSV format. Since it's Python it can be easily modified to use any other format, all it needs is date (or date/time depending on the timeframe of SR zones you want to create) and closing price.

Usage suggestion: If testing a strategy to trade S&R zones, use 'conservative' parameters to produce a smaller list of high probability zones. I.e., higher values of min_ht and min_touches and narrow zones. If testing a strategy to *avoid* trading in S&R zones, use 'aggressive' parameters to produce a larger list of zones.

Testing to verify code:

Run with the provided EURCAD test file as input.
Use these parameters: 

--pair EUR/CAD --fromdate 01/01/2010 --todate 1/11/2022 --period 250 --min_ht 0.02 --zone_width 0.0075 --min_touches 4

It should produce a file matching the attached SR_EURCAD_daily.pickle

Extract of that output file:

(This represents a "feature" that should probably be eliminated: I ran it using historical data ending in 2022-07-29, so it really shouldn't calculate SR zones for 2023-01-02)
